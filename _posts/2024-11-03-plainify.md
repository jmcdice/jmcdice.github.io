description: Transforming complex documents into readable content using AI - a Python tool that makes technical papers accessible to everyone.
---

Have you ever opened a medical paper or technical document and felt like you were reading an alien language? I certainly have. After spending hours decoding a particularly dense medical research paper, I thought there had to be a better way. That's how Plainify was born - a tool that takes complex documents and makes them genuinely readable, without losing their original meaning.

What makes Plainify different from just throwing a PDF at ChatGPT is its preservation of document structure and systematic approach to simplification. Instead of getting a summarized blob of text, you get a properly formatted document where technical terms are explained right where they appear, making it easy to learn as you read.

## What It Does

It re-writes the entire paper in easy to understand/lay-person lingo and writes it out in markdown. 

At its core, Plainify does something seemingly simple but surprisingly complex: it takes a PDF document (like a medical paper or technical specification) and turns it into a Markdown file where every technical term is explained in plain English. It's like having a knowledgeable friend reading alongside you, explaining things as you go.

For example, when it encounters a sentence like:
```markdown
The patient presented with acute myocardial infarction and severe dyspnea.
```

It transforms it into:
```markdown
The patient came in with a heart attack (when blood flow to the heart is blocked) 
and severe difficulty breathing (trouble getting enough air into the lungs).
```

## The Technical Bits

If you're interested in using Plainify, here's what you need to know:

### Quick Start
```bash
  # Clone and set up
  git clone https://github.com/jmcdice/plainify.git
  cd plainify
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Run it
  mkdir outputs
  ./plainify complex_paper.pdf outputs/simplified_paper.md
```

### Key Features
- Converts PDFs to Markdown with preserved formatting
- Explains technical terms in parentheses
- Handles large documents by splitting them intelligently
- Processes chunks concurrently for better performance
- Includes comprehensive logging for when things go wrong

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- A few Python packages (all in requirements.txt)
- Tesseract OCR (optional, for scanned documents)

## Under the Hood

The magic happens in four stages:
1. The PDF is converted to Markdown while preserving its structure
2. The content is split into chunks that preserve context
3. Each chunk is processed by GPT-3.5-turbo to identify and explain complex terms
4. Everything is reassembled into a clean, readable document

## Limitations and Future Plans

Currently, Plainify works best with text-based PDFs and may struggle with heavily formatted documents or complex tables. I'm working on improving these areas, along with adding support for:
- More document formats
- Custom terminology dictionaries
- Batch processing
- A simple web interface

## Try It Yourself

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmcdice/plainify) under the MIT license. If you run into any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
