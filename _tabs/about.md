Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Joey, a passionate technologist and software engineer with over two decades of experience in building systems, automating workflows, and architecting solutions with cutting-edge technologies.

## Who I Am

I currently work as a Systems Architect at Broadcom, specializing in Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, and platform engineering. My background includes 23 years of professional software development experience, spanning multiple programming languages and technology stacks, with a deep focus on **AI-powered solutions**.

I love to explore new ways to integrate AI into everyday problems and make systems more intelligent and responsive. This site is where I list my various AI projects, from intelligent dispatch systems to automated book generation.

## What I Do

Some of my key interests and projects include:
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Building AI systems that can write books, document code, gather and analyse news, HAM radio integrations, etc.
- **Kubernetes and Cloud-Native Solutions**: Architecting and automating cloud platforms.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Contributing to the ecosystem and sharing useful tools.
- **Platform Engineering**: Helping the enterprise and startups scale and optimize their infrastructure.

## Background

I've been fascinated with technology since middle school, and after completing my undergraduate studies in economics, I pursued a career in software development. Over the years, Iâ€™ve expanded my knowledge and skills across a range of tools and platforms, making technology work for both business and creative needs.
